CHAPTER 1:
Create a file named basic_operations.py.
In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].

CHAPTER 2:
Create a file named simple_interest.py.
Define three variables in this file:
principal with a value of 1000 (representing $1000),
rate with a value of 0.05 (representing 5% annual interest rate),
time with a value of 3 (representing 3 years).
Calculate the simple interest using the formula provided and store the result in a variable named interest.
Print the calculated interest in a format: The simple interest is: [interest].
